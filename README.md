# Shadow & Bold: Fan-made fonts for the world of Shadow & Bone

Shadow & Bold is an open-source collection of fonts developed by Christian Thalmann ([Catharsis Fonts][1]) for the writing systems created by [David J. Peterson][11] for [Netflix' "Shadow & Bone" adaptation][2] of [Leigh Bardugo's Grishaverse books][3]. The source files are in [Glyphs][4] format, and TrueType files are provided for installation.

Any feedback, bug reports, test results, and suggestions for additions are very welcome. You can contact me using the [Shadow & Bold issue tracker][5]. 

If you like these fonts, please help spread the word via the social media of your choice. You might also be interested in my other typefaces on [MyFonts][1] and in my other free type families [Cormorant][6] and [Ysabeau][7].

### Fonts

* The Ravkan Book font is an interpretation of the Ravkan writing system in the style of our world's Modern Serif typefaces, meant to evoke the sophistication of book printing. The Standard Ligatures OpenType feature (LIGA) of the font is used to turn typed text into Ravkan words; without Standard Ligatures activated, it will display Latin letters drawn to match the Ravkan style. 
* The Ravkan Book Latin font is a copy of Ravkan Book Regular with the LIGA feature permanently disabled, allowing you to type in Latin letters without them turning into Ravkan letters.
* The Ravkan Grotesk font is an interpretation of the Ravkan writing system in the style of our world's early advertising sans-serifs, meant to be used for shop fronts, posters, etc. Like Ravkan Book, it relies on the Standard Ligatures feature to work properly.

### Installation

If you wish to use the Shadow & Bold fonts on your computer, simply download the "SBFonts.zip" file from the [latest release][8], unpack it, and install the TrueType font files (.ttf) as appropriate for your operating system.

You must activate Standard Ligatures in the application in which you wish to use the fonts, otherwise you will only see the Latin letters. Remember kids, if you can read it, it's not Ravkan!

### License
 
The Shadow & Bold typefaces and all their associated font files are free software under the [SIL Open Font License][9]. Essentially, this gives you the right to download, use, and redistribute the fonts as you like, provided that 

1. you retain my copyright notices;
2. you do not redistribute this software without this license information; and 
3. you do not redistribute the fonts by themselves for a fee (though you are allowed to sell them as part of a bundle containing other items.)

These typefaces are provided to the Shadow & Bone community as fan art and are not meant to infringe on the intellectual properties of Netflix, the producers of Shadow & Bone, or Leigh Bardugo. The Ravkan writing system is public knowledge since David J. Peterson explained how it works on [Twitter][10].
